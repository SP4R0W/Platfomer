### About
-------------
This is my first true game made in Godot v3.5.1. It was made using C# and it features 5 short levels, each with unique setting and different enemies. <br> This game is perfect for speedrunning and an optional speedruning mode is available in the settings.

### Getting Started
-------------
To compile this project, you will need at least Godot Mono v3.5.1. Do not forget you will need the required export templates. <br> 
More in-depth guide is avaiable here: https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_projects.html <br>
You're free to modify the project as you wish.
